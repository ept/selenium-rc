=========================
Selenium Reference
=========================

    A **command** is what tells Selenium what to do. Selenium commands come in two 'flavors', **Actions** and **Assertions**.
    Each command call is one line in the test table of the form:

        ======= ====== =====
        command target value
        ======= ====== =====

    **Actions** are commands that generally manipulate the state of the application. They do things like "click this link" and "select that option". If an Action fails, or has an error, the execution of the current test is stopped.

    **Checks** verify the state of the application conforms to what is expected. Examples include "make sure the page title is X" and "check that this checkbox is checked". It is possible to tell Selenium to stop the test when an Assertion fails, or to simply record the failure and continue.

    **Element Locators** tell Selenium which HTML element a command refers to. Many commands require an Element Locator as the "target" attribute. Examples of Element Locators include "elementId" and "document.forms[0].element". These are described more clearly in the next section.

-----------------
Element Locators
-----------------

    Element Locators allow Selenium to identify which HTML element a command refers to. There are several forms of Element Locators.

    **id**
        locates an element based on the id or name attribute of the element. If an element with a matching *id* is found, it is chosen.
            - id=TheElementId

    **name**
        locates an element based on the name attribute of the element. The first element with a matching *name* is chosen.
            - name=TheElementName

    **identifier**
        locates an element based on the id or name attribute of the element. If an element with a matching *id* is found, it is chosen. Otherwise, the first element with a matching *name* is chosen.
            - name=TheElementName

    **dom**
        finds an element using the built-in DOM traversal syntax of HTML. DOM Traversal locators *must* begin with "document.".
            - dom=document.forms['myForm'].myDropdown
            - dom=document.images[56]

    **xpath**
        locates an element using a defined XPath expression. XPath locators *must* begin with "//".
            - xpath=//img[@alt='The image alt text']
            - xpath=//table[@id='table1']//tr[4]/td[2]

    **link**
        finds a link with the specified text.
            - link=The link text


    Without a locator prefix, a default set of locators will be used. The default set of locators is:

    1. identifier
    2. dom
    3. xpath

------------------------
Select Option Specifiers
------------------------

    Select Option Specifiers provide different ways of specifying options of an HTML Select element (e.g. for selecting a specific option, or for asserting that the selected option satisfies a specification).  There are several forms of Select Option Specifier.

    **label**
        matches options based on their labels, i.e. the visible text.  Does glob matching so that, for example, "fo*r" will match <option>foobar</option>.
            - label=TheLabel

    **value**
        matches options based on their values.  Does glob matching so that, for example, "fo*r" will match <option value="foobar">Some option</option>.
            - value=TheValue

    **id**
        matches options based on their ids.  Does glob matching so that, for example, "opt*1" will match <option id="option1" value="foobar">Some option</option>.
            - id=option1

    **index**
        matches an option based on its index (offset from zero).
            - index=2

    Without a prefix, the default is to only match on labels.

----------------
Selenium Actions
----------------

    Actions tell Selenium to do something in the application. They generally represent something a user would do.

    Many **Actions** can be called with the "AndWait" suffix. This suffix tells Selenium that the action will cause the browser to make a call to the server, and that Selenium should wait for a new page to load.
    The exceptions to this pattern are the "open" and "click" actions, which will both wait for a page to load by default.

    **open**
        Opens a URL in the test frame.  This accepts both relative and absolute URLs.
        
        *Note*: The URL must be on the same site as Selenium due to security restrictions in the browser (Cross Site Scripting).
        
        **target:** The URL to open.
        
        **value:** *ignored*
        
        **examples:**
            
            ====  =================  =====
            open  /mypage
            open  http://localhost/
            ====  =================  =====

    **click (clickAndWait)**
        Clicks on a link, button, checkbox or radio button.
        If the click action causes a new page to load (like a link usually does), use "clickAndWait".
        
        **target:** The id of the element that should be clicked.
        
        **value:** *ignored*

        **examples:**
            
            ============   ==================  =====
            click          aCheckbox
            clickAndWait   submitButton
            clickAndWait   anyLink
            ============   ==================  =====

        **note:**
            Selenium will *always* automatically click on a popup dialog raised by the alert() or confirm()
            methods. (The exception is those raised during 'onload', which are not yet handled by Selenium).
            You *must* use [verify|assert]Alert or [verify|assert]Confirmation to tell Selenium that you expect the
            popup dialog. You may use chooseCancelOnNextConfirmation to click 'cancel' on the next confirmation
            dialog instead of clicking 'OK'.


    **type (typeAndWait)**
        Types (enters) text into an input field.  This works for text fields, combo boxes, check boxes, etc.
        
        **target:** The id of the element where the text should be typed.
        
        **value:** The text that will be typed, or the value of the option selected (not the visible text).
        
        **examples:**
            
            ===========    ==========================   ==========
            type           nameField                    John Smith
            typeAndWait    textBoxThatSubmitsOnChange   newValue
            ===========    ==========================   ==========

    **select (selectAndWait)**
        Select an option from a drop-down, based on a Select Option Specifier.

        **target:** An Element Locator specifying an HTML Select element.

        **value:** An Option Specifier.  If more than one option matches (e.g. due to the use of globs like "f*b*", or due to more than one option having the same label or value), then the first option that matches is selected.

        **examples:**

            =============  ================   ==========
            select         dropDown           Australian Dollars
            select         dropDown           index=0
            selectAndWait  currencySelector   value=AUD
            selectAndWait  currencySelector   label=Aus*lian D*rs
            =============  ================   ==========

    **selectWindow**
        Selects a popup window.  Once a popup window has been selected, all commands go to that window.  To select the main window again, use "null" as the target.
        
        **target:** The id of the window to select.
        
        **value:** *ignored*
        
        **examples:**
            
            ============    =============   =====
            selectWindow    myPopupWindow   
            selectWindow    null
            ============    =============   =====

    **pause**
        Pauses the execution of the test script for a specified amount of time.  This is useful for debugging a script or pausing to wait for some server side action.
        
        **target:** The number of milliseconds to pause.
        
        **value:** *ignored*
        
        **examples:**
            
            =====   ====  =====
            pause   5000
            pause   2000    
            =====   ====  =====

    **waitForValue**
        Waits for a specified input (e.g. a hidden field) to have a specified value.  Will succeed immediately if the input already has the value.  Is implemented by polling for the value.  Warning: can block indefinitely if the input never has the specified value.

        **target:** The input field.
        
        **value:** The value the input field must have before continuing.
        
        **example:**
            
            ============   ================  ==========
            waitForValue   finishIndication  isfinished
            ============   ================  ==========


    **goBack**
        Simulates the user clicking the "back" button on their browser.

        **target:** *ignored*

        **value:** *ignored*

        **examples:**

            ======   ====  =====
            goBack
            ======   ====  =====

Selenium Checks
---------------
    Checks are used to verify the state of the application. They can be used to check the value of a form field, the presense of some text, or the URL of the current page.

    All Selenium Checks can be used in 2 modes, "assert" and "verify". These behave identically, except that when an "assert" check fails, the test is aborted. When a "verify" check fails, the test will continue execution.
    This allows a single "assert" to ensure that the application is on the correct page, followed by a bunch of "verify" checks to test form field values, labels, etc.

    **verifyLocation / assertLocation**
        Verifies the location of the current page being tested.
        
        **target:** The expected relative location of the page.
        
        **value:** *ignored*
        
        **examples:**
            
            ==============   =======  =====
            verifyLocation   /mypage
            assertLocation   /mypage
            ==============   =======  =====

    **verifyTitle / assertTitle**
        Verifies the title of the current page.

        **target:** The expected page title.

        **value:** *ignored*

        **examples:**

            ===========   =======  =====
            verifyTitle   My Page
            assertTitle   My Page
            ===========   =======  =====

    **verifyValue / assertValue**
        Verifies the value of an input field (or anything else with a value parameter). For checkbox/radio elements, the value will be "on" or "off" depending on whether the element is checked or not.
        
        **target:** The id of the element to verify.
        
        **value:** The expected value.
        
        **examples:**
            
            ===========   ===========================   ==========
            verifyValue   nameField                     John Smith
            assertValue   document.forms[2].nameField   John Smith
            ===========   ===========================   ==========

    **verifySelected / assertSelected**
        Verifies that the selected option of a drop-down satisfies a specified Select Option Specifier.

        **target:** Locates the drop-down to verify.

        **value:** A Select Option Specifier that the selected option is expected to satisfy.

        **examples:**

            ==============   ===========================   ==========
            verifySelected   dropdown2                     John Smith
            verifySelected   dropdown2                     value=js*123
            assertSelected   document.forms[2].dropDown    label=J* Smith
            assertSelected   document.forms[2].dropDown    index=0
            ==============   ===========================   ==========

    **verifySelectOptions / assertSelectOptions**
        Verifies the labels of all options in a drop-down against a comma-separated list. Commas in an expected option can be escaped as "\,".

        **target:** Locates the drop-down to verify.

        **value:** A comma-separated list of option labels.

        **examples:**

            ===================   ===========================   ====================
            verifySelectOptions   dropdown2                     John Smith,Dave Bird
            assertSelectOptions   document.forms[2].dropDown    Smith\\, J,Bird\\, D
            ===================   ===========================   ====================

    **verifyText / assertText**
        Verifies the text of an element.  This works for any element that contains text.  This command uses either the textContent (Mozilla-like browsers) or the innerText (IE-like browsers) of the element, which is the rendered text shown to the user.
        
        **target:** The id of the element to verify.
        
        **value:** The expected text.
        
        **examples:**
            
            ==========   ====================   ==========
            verifyText   statusMessage          Successful
            assertText   //div[@id='foo']//h1   Successful
            ==========   ====================   ==========

    **verifyAttribute / assertAttribute**
        Verifies the value of an element attribute. An attribute is identified using the syntax <element-locator>@<attribute-name>. This works for all types of element locators.

        **target:** A locator string of the format <element-locator>@<attribute-name>

        **value:** The expected attribute value.

        **examples:**

            ===============   ======================   ==========
            verifyAttribute   txt1@class               bigAndBold
            assertAttribute   document.images[0]@alt   alt-text
            verifyAttribute   //img[@id='foo']/@alt    alt-text
            ===============   ======================   ==========

    **verifyTextPresent / assertTextPresent**
        Verifies that the specified text appears somewhere on the rendered page shown to the user.
        
        **target:** The text that should be present.
        
        **value:** *ignored*
        
        **examples:**
            
            =================   ======================   =====
            verifyTextPresent   You are now logged in.

            =================   ======================   =====

    **verifyTextNotPresent / assertTextNotPresent**
        Verifies that the specified text does not appears anywhere on the rendered page.
        
        **target:** The text that should not be present.
        
        **value:** *ignored*
        
    **verifyElementPresent / assertElementPresent**
        Verifies that the specified element is somewhere on the page.

            =======================   ============   =====

    **verifyTable / assertTable**
        Verifies the text in a cell of a table. The correct syntax of the target is tableName.row.column, where row and column start at 0.
        
        **target:** The table, row, and column specified as table.row.col.
        
        **value:** The expected value of the cell.
        
        **examples:**

            ===========   ===========   =========

    **verifyVisible / assertVisible**
        Verifies that the specified element is both present *and* visible. An element can be rendered invisible by setting the CSS "visibility" property to "hidden", or the "display" property to "none", either for the element itself or one if its ancestors.
        
        **target:** The element that should be visible.
        
        **value:** *ignored*
        
        **examples:**
            
            =============   ========   =====

            =============   ========   =====

    **verifyNotVisible / assertNotVisible**
        Verifies that the specified element is not visible.  Elements that are simply not present are also considered invisible.
        
        **target:** The element that should not be visible.
        
        **value:** *ignored*
        
        **examples:**
            
            ================   ========   =====
            verifyNotVisible   postcode
            assertNotVisible   postcode
            ================   ========   =====

    **verifyEditable / assertEditable**
        Verifies that the specified element is editable, ie. it's an input
        element, and hasn't been disabled.
        
        **target:** The element that should be editable.
        
        **value:** *ignored*
        
        **examples:**
            
            ==============   ========   =====
            verifyEditable   shape
            assertEditable   colour
            ==============   ========   =====

    **verifyNotEditable / assertNotEditable**
        Verifies that the specified element is NOT editable, ie. it's NOT
        an input element, or has been disabled.
        
        **target:** The element that should be read-only.
        
        **value:** *ignored*
        
        **examples:**
            
            =================   ===========   =====
            verifyNotEditable   creditLimit
            assertNotEditable   userName
            =================   ===========   =====

    **verifyAlert / assertAlert**
        Verifies that a javascript alert was generated and that the text of the alert was as specified.
        Alerts must be verified in the same order that they were generated.

        Verifying an alert has the same effect as manually clicking OK.
        If an alert is generated but you do not verify it, the next Selenium action will fail.

        NOTE: under Selenium, javascript alerts will NOT pop up a visible alert dialog.

        NOTE: Selenium does NOT support javascript alerts that are generated in a page's onload() event handler.
        In this case a visible dialog WILL be generated and Selenium will hang until you manually click OK.

        **target:** The expected text of the alert.

        **value:** *ignored*

        **examples:**

            ==============   ====================  =====
            verifyAlert      Invalid Phone Number
            assertAlert      Invalid Phone Number
            ==============   ====================  =====

    **verifyConfirmation / assertConfirmation**
        Verifies that a javascript confirmation dialog was generated and that
        the text of the dialog was as specified.
        Confirm dialogs must be verified in the same order that they were generated.

        By default, the confirm function will return true, having the same effect as manually clicking OK.
        This can be changed by prior execution of the **chooseCancelOnNextConfirmation** command (see below).
        If an confirmation is generated but you do not verify it, the next Selenium action will fail.

        NOTE: under Selenium, javascript confirmations will NOT pop up a visible dialog.

        NOTE: Selenium does NOT support javascript confirmations that are generated in a page's onload() event handler.
        In this case a visible dialog WILL be generated and Selenium will hang until you manually click OK.

        **target:** The expected text of the alert.

        **value:** *ignored*

        **examples:**

            ==================   ====================  =====
            verifyConfirmation   Invalid Phone Number
            assertAlert          Invalid Phone Number
            ==================   ====================  =====

    **chooseCancelOnNextConfirmation**
        Instructs Selenium to click **Cancel** on the next javascript confirmation dialog to be raised.
        By default, the confirm function will return true, having the same effect as manually clicking OK.
        After running this command, the next confirmation will behave as if the user had clicked Cancel.

        **target:** *ignored*

        **value:** *ignored*

        **examples:**

            ==============================   =====  =====
            chooseCancelOnNextConfirmation
            ==============================   =====  =====

Parameter construction and Variables
------------------------------------

    All Selenium command parameters can be constructed using both simple
    variable substitution as well as full javascript. Both of these
    mechanisms can access previously stored variables, but do so using
    different syntax.

    **Stored Variables**

    The commands *store*, *storeValue* and *storeText* can be used to store a variable
    value for later access. Internally, these variables are stored in a map called "storedVars",
    with values keyed by the variable name. These commands are documented in the command reference.

    **Variable substitution**

    Variable substitution provides a simple way to include a previously stored variable in a
    command parameter. This is a simple mechanism, by which the variable to substitute is indicated
    by ${variableName}. Multiple variables can be substituted, and intermixed with static text.

    Example:
        ==========   ====================       ==========
        store        Mr                         title
        storeValue   nameField                  surname
        store        ${title} ${surname}        fullname
        type         textElement                Full name is: ${fullname}
        ==========   ====================       ==========

    **Javascript evaluation**

    Javascript evaluation provides the full power of javascript in constructing a command parameter.
    To use this mechanism, the *entire* parameter value must be prefixed by
    'javascript{' with a trailing '}'. The text inside the braces is evaluated as a javascript expression,
    and can access previously stored variables using the *storedVars* map detailed above.
    Note that variable substitution cannot be combined with javascript evaluation.

    Example:
        ==========   ================================================   ==========
        store        javascript{'merchant' + (new Date()).getTime()}    merchantId
        type         textElement                                        javascript{storedVars['merchantId'].toUpperCase()}
        ==========   ================================================   ==========

Extending Selenium
------------------

    It can be quite simple to extend Selenium, adding your own actions, checks and locator-strategies.
    This is done with javascript by adding methods to the Selenium object prototype, and the PageBot
    object prototype. On startup, Selenium will automatically look through methods on these prototypes,
    using name patterns to recognise which ones are actions, checks and locators.

    The following examples try to give an indication of how Selenium can be extended with javascript.

**Actions**
    All *doFoo* methods on the Selenium prototype are added as actions. For each action *foo* there
    is also an action *fooAndWait* registered. An action method can take up to 2 parameters, which
    will be passed the second and third column values in the test.

    Example: Add a "typeRepeated" action to Selenium, which types the text twice into a text box.

::

    Selenium.prototype.doTypeRepeated = function(locator, text) {
        // All locator-strategies are automatically handled by "findElement"
        var element = this.page().findElement(locator);

        // Create the text to type
        var valueToType = text + text;

        // Replace the element text with the new text
        this.page().replaceText(element, valueToType);
    };

**Checks**
    All *assertFoo* methods on the Selenium prototype are added as checks. For each check *foo* there
    is an *assertFoo* and *verifyFoo* registered. An assert method can take up to 2 parameters, which
    will be passed the second and third column values in the test.

    Example: Add a *valueRepeated* check, that makes sure that the element value
    consists of the supplied text repeated. The 2 commands that would be available in tests would be
    *assertValueRepeated* and *verifyValueRepeated*.

::

    Selenium.prototype.assertValueRepeated = function(locator, text) {
        // All locator-strategies are automatically handled by "findElement"
        var element = this.page().findElement(locator);

        // Create the text to verify
        var expectedValue = text + text;

        // Get the actual element value
        var actualValue = element.value;

        // Make sure the actual value matches the expected
        this.assertMatches(expectedValue, actualValue);
    };

**Locator Strategies**
    All *locateElementByFoo* methods on the PageBot prototype are added as locator-strategies. A
    locator strategy takes 2 parameters, the first being the locator string (minus the prefix),
    and the second being the document in which to search.

    Example: Add a "valuerepeated=" locator, that finds the first element a value attribute equal
    to the the supplied value repeated.

::

    // The "inDocument" is a the document you are searching.
    PageBot.prototype.locateElementByValueRepeated = function(text, inDocument) {
        // Create the text to search for
        var expectedValue = text + text;

        // Loop through all elements, looking for ones that have a value === our expected value
        var allElements = inDocument.getElementsByTagName("*");
        for (var i = 0; i < allElements.length; i++) {
            var testElement = allElements[i];
            if (testElement.value && testElement.value === expectedValue) {
                return testElement;
            }
        }
        return null;
    };

**user-extensions.js**
    By default, Selenium looks for a file called "user-extensions.js", and loads and javascript code
    found in that file. This file provides a convenient location for adding features to Selenium, without
    needing to modify the core Selenium sources.

    In the standard distibution, this file does not exist. Users can create this file and place their
    extension code in this common location, removing the need to modify the Selenium sources,
    and hopefully assisting with the upgrade process.
