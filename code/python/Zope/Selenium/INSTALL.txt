
This has been tested with Plone 2.0.4.

1) Copy the Selenium directory to your Plone Products folder (<Plone_Instance_Home>/Products/).

2) Use the Plone QuickInstaller to install the Plone product.
    a) Login to plone  as admin (not the Zope Management Interface (ZMI), but the Plone interface)
    b) Click preferences
    c) Click Add/Remove Products
    d) Select "Selenium", then click "install"


3) The default Selenium self-tests should now be available for you to run them at:
    http://localhost/TestRunner.html

    The TestRunner.html file is *really* stored here:
    <Plone_Instance_Home>/Products/Selenium/skins/selenium_javascript/TestRunner.html.dtml

    and it makes a reference to the TestSuite.html file located here:
    <Plone_Instance_Home>/Products/Selenium/skins/selenium_javascript/tests/TestSuite.html.dtml

    which refers to the actual tests located in the same folder:
    <Plone_Instance_Home>/Products/Selenium/skins/selenium_javascript/tests/*
