Selenium is a testing tool for web applications. Selenium tests run directly in a web browser. And they run in Internet Explorer, Mozilla and Firefox on Windows, Linux and Macintosh. No other testing tool covers such a wide array of platforms.

Selenium can be used for:

    * Browser compatability testing. Test your application to see if it works correctly on different browsers and operating systems. The same script can run on any Selenium platform.

    * System functional testing. Create regression tests to verify application functionality and user acceptance.
