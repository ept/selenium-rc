With Ruby installed on your computer....

Change directories to ./ruby.
Run selenium_example.rb

Your default browser should open, and ruby will drive the testing with Selenium.

If a browser doesn't automatically launch (probably if you're not running windows), open FireFox/Mozilla
and point it at http://localhost:7896/selenium-driver/SeleneseRunner.html to kick-off the tests.
