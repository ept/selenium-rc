1. Ownership and License


Electric XML is owned by The Mind Electric and is copyrighted and licensed, not sold. The Mind Electric grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use, modify and distribute Electric XML in both binary and source form as long as all of the following conditions are met:
You are not bundling Electric XML or a derivative of it as part of a software development environment such as JBuilder, WebGain or VisualAge. Note that this restriction is targeted at IDE vendors, and does not prevent developers from loading Electric XML into an IDE and using it during everyday development. 


You are not integrating Electric XML or a derivative of it into a distributed computing infrastructure or database platform such as WebLogic, Apache SOAP, WebSphere, Oracle application server, or HP e-speak. Note that this restriction is targeted at software infrastructure vendors, and does not prevent developers from using and bundling Electric XML with applications that run on these platforms. 


You are not integrating Electric XML or a derivative of it into an alternative to Electric XML such as Xerces or JDOM. 


You must not remove any of the copyright information from the Electric XML source code or documentation. 

If you cannot meet all of these conditions, please contact us to arrange a special custom license.
