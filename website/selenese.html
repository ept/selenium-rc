<p>Selenese HTML Tables are normally tested using Selenium IDE or using Selenium Core by itself.  (The Selenium Server includes its own copy of Selenium Core.)  But there are a few ways you can use the Selenium Server with your Selenese HTML Tables.</p>


<h3>Running Selenese Core Tests against an unmodified website</h3>

<p>To run Selenium Core tests, they normally have to be installed on the server on which you want to test.  That means that you can't just write a Selenium Core test against google.com, because you'd need to install Selenium Core on google.com for those tests to work.</p>

<p>The Selenium Server's client-configured proxy allows you to run your tests against any web site, by making the browser think that your tests are available at (for example) http://www.google.com/selenium-server/MyTestSuite.html.</p>

<p>To use the Selenium Server as a proxy, run your tests like this:</p>

<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;java&nbsp;-jar&nbsp;selenium-server.jar&nbsp;-htmlSuite&nbsp;"*firefox"&nbsp;"http://www.google.com"&nbsp;"c:\absolute\path\to\my\HTMLSuite.html"&nbsp;"c:\absolute\path\to\my\results.html"&nbsp;-timeout&nbsp;30</tt></p>

<p>That will automatically launch your HTML suite and wait the specified number of seconds for the test to complete; if the test doesn't complete within that amount of time, the command will exit with a non-zero exit code and no results file will be generated.</p>

<p>Note that this command line is very long and <i>very</i> finicky... be careful when you type it in.  (You can use the -htmlSuite parameter with the -port and -timeout options, but it is incompatible with -interactive; you can't do both of those at once.)  Also note that it requires you to pass in an HTML Selenese <i>suite</i>, not a single test.</p>


<h3>Running Selenese Tests under Continuous Integration</h3>

<p>If you just want to use the Selenium Server as a quick-and-dirty way to launch your HTML Selenese suites from the command line and generate results automatically, you can do that, too, just by following the instructions above.</p>

<p>We've also provided an Ant task to make it easier to launch the tests.  Run it like this:</p><blockquote><code>
&lt;taskdef&nbsp;resource="selenium-ant.properties"&gt;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;classpath&gt;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;pathelement&nbsp;location="selenium-server.jar"/&gt;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/classpath&gt;<br/>
&lt;/taskdef&gt;<br/>
&lt;selenese&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suite="c:\absolute\path\to\my\HTMLSuite.html"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;browser="*firefox"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;results="c:\absolute\path\to\my\results.html"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;multiWindow="true"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;timeoutInSeconds="900"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;startURL="http://www.google.com"&nbsp;/&gt;
</code></blockquote>See the <a href="server/org/openqa/selenium/server/ant/SeleneseAntTask.html">javadoc</a> for additional configuration details.
    


<h3> Translate Selenese Tests into Another Language </h3>

The latest versions of <a href="/selenium-ide/">Selenium IDE</a> include outstanding support for translating HTML Selenese tests into other languages; the latest version supports converting HTML Selenese into Java, C#, Perl, Python and Ruby.  The Selenium IDE translator is an excellent migration tool for when you've outgrown some of the limitations of HTML Selenese.
