<p>Selenese HTML Tables are normally tested using Selenium IDE or using Selenium Core by itself.  (The Selenium Server includes its own copy of Selenium Core.)  But there are a few ways you can use the Selenium Server with your Selenese HTML Tables.</p>


<h3>Running Selenese Core Tests against an unmodified website</h3>

<p>To run Selenium Core tests, they normally have to be installed on the server on which you want to test.  That means that you can't just write a Selenium Core test against google.com, because you'd need to install Selenium Core on google.com for those tests to work.</p>

<p>The Selenium Server's client-configured proxy allows you to run your tests against any web site, by making the browser think that your tests are available at (for example) http://www.google.com/selenium-server/MyTestSuite.html.</p>

<p>To use the Selenium Server as a proxy, run your tests like this:</p>

<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;java&nbsp;-jar&nbsp;selenium-server.jar&nbsp;-htmlSuite&nbsp;"*firefox"&nbsp;"http://www.google.com"&nbsp;"c:\absolute\path\to\my\HTMLSuite.html"&nbsp;"c:\absolute\path\to\my\results.html"&nbsp;-timeout&nbsp;30</tt></p>

<p>(You can also use the -htmlSuite parameter with the -port and -timeout options, but it is incompatible with -interactive; you can't do both of those at once.)</p>

<p>That will automatically launch your HTML suite and wait the specified number of seconds for the test to complete; if the test doesn't complete within that amount of time, the command will exit with a non-zero exit code and no results file will be generated.</p>

<h3>Running Selenese Tests under Continuous Integration</h3>

<p>If you just want to use the Selenium Server as a quick-and-dirty way to launch your HTML Selenese suites from the command line and generate results automatically, you can do that, too, just by following the instructions above.</p>

<h3> XlateHtmlSeleneseToJava: a translation tool to convert Selenese HTML tests to Java</h3>

We have a tool that we use to automatically convert Selenese HTML tests into Java.  
<p>
Selenese HTML tests have no support for conditional "if" statements or looping "while" statements.  There is also no way to reuse testing code within other tests.
<p>
If you need a more expressive language to write your tests, then you may benefit from using our tool to migrate your existing Selenium tests into Java.  Currently the selenium-rc nightly build uses this tool to convert most of the HTML tests into RC tests, which end up living in rc/clients/java/src/test/java/com/thoughtworks/selenium/corebased.  Interested parties can inspect the invocation of the translator in rc/clients/java/generate-sources.xml:23:
<p>
<code>
	&lt;java classname="org.openqa.selenium.server.testgenerator.XlateHtmlSeleneseToJava" fork="true" failonerror="true"&gt;
	&lt;arg value="${dir.java.tests.based.on.core.javascript}"/&gt;
	&lt;arg value="-silent"/&gt;
	&lt;arg value="-dontThrowOnTranslationDifficulties"/&gt;
	&lt;arg value="-dir"/&gt;
	&lt;arg value="${dir.core.tests}"/&gt;
	&lt;classpath refid="depend.classpath"/&gt;
	&lt;/java&gt;
</code>
<p>
The dir argument tells it to translate everything within a directory. It is possible to also invoke it so as to translate a single class. Here's another sample invocation in bash:
<p>
<code>
	cp="z:/shared/p4/Dev/selenium-rc_svn/trunk/rc/server/target/test-classes;z:/shared/p4/Dev/selenium-rc_svn/trunk/rc/server/eclipse;C:/Documents and Settings/nelsons/.m2/repository/junit/junit/3.8.1/junit-3.8.1.jar;C:/Documents and Settings/nelsons/.m2/repository/commons-logging/commons-logging/1.0.4/commons-logging-1.0.4.jar;C:/Documents and Settings/nelsons/.m2/repository/ant/ant/1.6.5/ant-1.6.5.jar;C:/Documents and Settings/nelsons/.m2/repository/javax/servlet/servlet-api/2.4/servlet-api-2.4.jar;C:/Documents and Settings/nelsons/.m2/repository/jetty/org.mortbay.jetty/5.1.10/org.mortbay.jetty-5.1.10.jar;$HOME/shared/p4/Dev/selenium-rc_svn/trunk/core/bin"
	java -ea -Dcode_root=. -classpath "$cp" org.openqa.selenium.server.testgenerator.XlateHtmlSeleneseToJava $HOME/shared/p4/Dev/selenium-rc_svn/trunk/rc/clients/java/src/test/java/com/thoughtworks/selenium/corebased $HOME/shared/p4/Dev/selenium-rc_svn/trunk/core/tests/TestSelect.html
</code>
<p>
This example takes as its input $HOME/shared/p4/Dev/selenium-rc_svn/trunk/core/tests/TestSelect.html, and produces as its output $HOME/shared/p4/Dev/selenium-rc_svn/trunk/rc/clients/java/src/test/java/com/thoughtworks/selenium/corebased/TestSelect.java.
