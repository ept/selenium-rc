<h2>Selenium Remote Control 0.9.2  (September 20, 2007)</h2>
<p>This release has been a long time coming; sorry about that.  We expect to be able to turn around versions a little faster now.
The previous release was 0.9.0; there was no 0.9.1.</p>

<p>New in this release:</p>
<ul>
<li> New PHP driver lets you write Selenium RC tests in PHP</li>
<li> Fixed our long broken Firefox 2 browser launcher</li>
<li> We can now reliably launch/kill IE7 on Vista in Protected mode with UAC enabled</li>
<li> New "captureScreenshot" command lets you capture PNG screenshots and save them to disk</li>
<li> New "getXpathCount" command tells you how many elements match a given XPath expression</li>
<li> New "addLocationStrategy" command lets you define new ways to locate elements on the page</li>
<li> Vastly improved stability in proxy injection mode -- it will probably become the default in a future version of Selenium RC.</li>
<li> Totally revamped logging </li>
</ul>

<p>This release also includes a few small changes to the API:</p>
<ul>
<li> "windowMaximize" and "windowFocus" no longer take an argument; just "selectWindow" to the window you want to maximize/focus before you call them.</li>
<li> The "getLogMessages" accessor has been removed; it never really worked properly anyway, and we now support much more sophisticated logging.</li>
<li> "setContext" no longer takes a logging level; use "setBrowserLogLevel" instead </li>
</ul>


<h2>Selenium Remote Control 0.9.0  (November 14, 2006)</h2>
<P>0.9.0 includes a bunch of new cool stuff, including frame support, multiWindow support (for testing apps that don't like to run in a subframe), a Konqueror browser launcher, new cookie-management actions, and support for Firefox 2.0 and IE7.  It also includes experimental support for SSL directly in the Selenium proxy, and a new highly experimental "proxy injection" mode that gives us more control over the application under test by modifying it in the HTTP proxy.</p>


<h2>Selenium Remote Control 0.8.1  (June 5, 2006)</h2>
<P>Don't be fooled by the version number; 0.8.1 is the next major release of Selenium Remote Control.</p>

<P>0.8.1 is identical to 0.8.0 but with a fix for the broken <i>-port</i> and <i>-timeout</i> command flag handling.</p>

<h2>Selenium Remote Control 0.8.0 (June 2, 2006)</h2>


<P>0.8.0 includes numerous significant bug fixes and enhancements.  New features include a Perl RC Client Driver, a translator from Selenium Core Selenese HTML test tables into Java JUnit tests and Opera 8.54 support.</p>

<P>We've also added experimental support for new browser launchers, "*chrome" and "*iehta" which, we hope, will one day eliminate the need for the Selenium Server proxy altogether, by running the Selenium JavaScript with elevated security privileges.  They're "experimental" because we're not 100% sure that they work, but many users have been enjoying them in the nightly snapshots for a while now, so you might want to give them a try.</p>

<P>Additionally, the API for Selenium RC 0.8.0 has changed slightly; Selenium 0.8.0 is not 100% backwards compatible with tests written in Selenium 0.7.x.  The changes should be minor; the most notable change is that the API no longer includes assertion commands.  Instead of running assertTextPresent, now you'll run an "isTextPresent" command which will return true/false, allowing you to run your own assertion code in the language/test framework with which you're most comfortable.</p>

<p>We do not anticipate having to break backwards compatibility again in the future; we waited a while for 0.8.0 to make sure we'd explored any additional changes we needed to make.</p>

<h2>Selenium Remote Control 0.7.1 (April 6, 2006)</h2>

0.7.1 is bug fix release to improve Firefox support on non-Windows 
browsers and improve Internet Explorer support on various versions 
of Windows.  The support matrix has also been updated to be a bit
more realistic; it was copied straight from Selenium Core, but
we are now more explicit about what is and isn't supported.

<h2>Selenium Remote Control 0.7.0 (March 31, 2006)</h2>

<p>Selenium Remote Control 0.7.0 was the first official release
of SRC as a separate project.  Previously, SRC was just a separate 
mode of the "Selenium" project; at that time it was called "Driven" mode.

SRC 0.7.0 has added the notion of a Selenium Server to act as both
a client-configured proxy for the browser (to resolve same-origin
issues) and to stand between Client Drivers and the browser, to
substantially simplify the process of writing Client Drivers in
many languages.
