<h2>Selenium Remote Control 0.7.0</h2>

<p>Selenium Remote Control 0.7.0 was the first official release
of SRC as a separate project.  Previously, SRC was just a separate 
mode of the "Selenium" project; at that time it was called "Driven" mode.

SRC 0.7.0 has added the notion of a Selenium Server to act as both
a client-configured proxy for the browser (to resolve same-origin
issues) and to stand between Client Drivers and the browser, to
substantially simplify the process of writing Client Drivers in
many languages.
