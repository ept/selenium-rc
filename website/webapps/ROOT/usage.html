This document details how Selenium can be deployed to test web
applications.<br>

<h2><a name="test-tables">Modes of Operation</a></h2>
Broadly speaking there are two modes of operation for Selenium
TestRunner and Driven<br>
<h3>TestRunner</h3>
TestRunner is a mode of operation for selenium. It is where Selenium
and its test suite is deployed alongside the Application Under Test
(AUT). The test suite is coded as HTML tables.<br>
<br>
See <a href="testrunner.html">test runner documentation</a> for more
information.<br>
<h3>Driven</h3>
Driven Selenium is where the browser is under the the control of an
adjacent process. That process is either a Java, .Net, Ruby or Python
application and it is typically run in conjunction with a unit testing
framework like JUnit or NUnit. Also possible, is a console application
driving a browser interactively. <br>
<br>
The test script is one that would be recognisable to people adept with
unit test frameworks :<br>
<br>
&nbsp; public void testOKClick() {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; selenium.verifyTitle("First Page");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; selenium.open("/TestPage.html");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; selenium.click("OKButton");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; selenium.verifyTitle("Another Page");<br>
&nbsp; }<br>
<br>
The difference from normal unit testing is that as part of the startup,
three major things have to happen:<br>
<ol>
  <li>The test framework needs to publish a fresh copy of the AUT.
Selenium prefers to mount its own web server temporarily for the
purposes of testing.</li>
  <li>The test framework needs to publish the static Selenium pages
(refer selenium dir in TestRunner mode above) in an apparent directory
on the same web server as (1).</li>
  <li>The test framework needs to open a browser instance and point it
to Selenium.html served in (2) above.</li>
</ol>
As each of these is a fairly time consuming operation, it is best that
all three of those happen in a one time setup mode.&nbsp; As such, and
even though these leverage a unit testing framework, this is definately
for acceptance or functional testing.<br>
