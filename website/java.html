<h1>Using the Java Client Driver
	
<h3><a href="javadoc/index.html">JavaDoc reference</a> is available</h3>

<p>First, make sure you've already started the Selenium Server separately in another process.  The Selenium Server should remain up and running throughout this process; you shouldn't need to start/stop it each time you use the Client Driver.  (Though, of course, if you need to start and stop the server, you certainly can, just by automatically starting it from the command line.)</p>

<p>Just add selenium-java-client-driver.jar to your classpath, and create a new DefaultSelenium object.  You'll need to give it the hostname and port of the Selenium Server, the browser string to use with "getNewBrowserSession", and the base URL at which we'll start testing.  When you're ready to begin, run the .start() method on your DefaultSelenium object; when it's time to close the browser, use the .stop() method.</p>

<p>The DefaultSelenium object is full of handy methods that handle your Selenium Commands.  If one of them has an error (or if an "assert" command fails) the method will throw an exception with a handy error message, which you can wrap up in a try/catch block if you like.</p>

<p>While we recommend that you use the Java Client Driver together with <a href="http://www.junit.org/">JUnit</a>, the de facto standard for Java automated tests, JUnit is not required; you can use the Java Client Driver with any program whatsoever to automate tasks in your browser.</p>
