                   Selenium-Client gem ChangeLog
                   =============================

1.2.11
======

 - Include examples in RubyGem
 - Added visible? method
 
1.2.10 
=======

 - Upgraded RSpec support to 1.1.12

 - Added popup support in wait_for semantics. e.g.

    click 'my_button', :wait_for => :popup, :window => 'a window id'
 
 - Fixed :wait_for => :text and :wait_for => :no_text semantics
   Thank you Wade Catron for finding the reporting this bug!
   
   The new semantics are:
   
   If you do not provide any locator the text is searched in the entire
   body of the page. e.g.
   
    click 'my_button', :wait_for => :text, :text => "Congratulations"
     
   If you provide and element locator the text search is scoped to the 
   innerHTML of that element. e.g.

    click 'my_button', :wait_for => :text, :element => "notification_box", :text => "Preferences Saved!"
    
  *** WARNING ****
  
    In the process I had to change the signature of the wait_for_text and
    wait_for_no_text methods. Please update your code if you were using
    directly any of these 2 methods:
    
    OLD:  wait_for_text(locator, text, timeout_in_seconds=nil)	  
    NEW:  wait_for_text(text, locator=nil, timeout_in_seconds=nil)

    OLD:  wait_for_no_text(locator, text, timeout_in_seconds=nil)	  
    NEW:  wait_for_no_text(text, locator=nil, timeout_in_seconds=nil)

 - More idiomatic methods to retrieves all window ids, names and titles:
       .all_window_ids, .all_window_names, all_window_titles
 
 - RSpec Helper automatically set context when starting a new test
   (lib/selenium/rspec/spec_helper)
