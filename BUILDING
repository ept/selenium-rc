Make sure there is a checkout of the selenium-core repository in
`../selenium-core` (relative to the directory containing this file).

Run `mvn install` in `../selenium-core`.

Return to this directory and run:

    mvn install -DskipTests -Pcore

If this is the first time building, Maven may need to update its plugins.
Add the `-U` option in that case.

`-DskipTests` is given because running the tests requires various browsers
to be set up correctly, which may not be the case on a development machine.
