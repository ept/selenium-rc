Release Notes - Selenium Remote Control 1.0

What's new in 1.0:
- Support for Firefox 3.0
- Support for Google Chrome 0.x
- *chrome is now a supported launcher type
- *iehta is now a supported launcher type
- *firefox defaults to *chrome
- *iexplore defaults to *iehta
- multiWindow by default for all launcher types
- Java client driver requires Java 5
- captureScreenshot now creates intermediate directories (SRC-438)
- captureEntirePageScreenshotToString/captureScreenshotToString allow client-side storage of screenshots

New server command line options:
- singleWindow: puts you into a mode where the test web site executes in a frame.
  This mode should only be selected if the application under test does not use frames.
- profilesLocation: Specifies the directory that holds the profiles that java clients can use to start up Selenium. 
  Currently supported for Firefox only. For further information see http://clearspace.openqa.org/docs/DOC-1192.
- forcedBrowserModeRestOfLine <browser>: sets the browser mode to all the remaining tokens on the line 
  (e.g. "*custom /some/random/place/iexplore.exe") for all sessions, no matter what is passed to getNewBrowserSession
- browserSideLog: enables logging on the browser side; logging messages will be transmitted to the server.
  This can affect performance.
- ensureCleanSession: If the browser does not have user profiles, make sure every new session has no artifacts 
  from previous sessions. For example, enabling this option will cause all user cookies to be archived before launching IE, 
  and restored after IE is closed.
